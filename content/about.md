Hello, World!

I am Andrea, 26 y.o. guy from the north of Italy.
Welcome to Tybeard. What the heck is this?! Let me explain.

Let's begin with the name. It's a fusion between typo and beard, with a little of remind to the word read.
Why? Well, it's a blog, so I type and you read. And the beard? I've been having a beard since 2010. It's kind of mark to me.

What are you going to find here?
You'll find stories, stories about .. dreams, mysterious nameless places all over the world, feelings and so more.

But let's be serious. I like writing about places I had visited, not in the conventional way. I think every city has its story, an untold story. My goal is to tell you what I felt there.

Also, my mind like to wander through various paths, and sometimes I made up with funny story, like the one of a little plastic lego-boy.

I guess you understand nothing about this presentation, and that's good, because you must read something now!
Hope you enjoy.

Yours,
Andrea
