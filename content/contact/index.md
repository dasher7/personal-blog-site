Hello, glad to see you again.

This blog it's not the only thing I have to keep us in touch.
There are plenty of social where you get to know me more.

First of all, my personal site: [andreabredice.dev](https://www.andreabredice.dev/)
You can know more about my job and about my little funny coding project, you know, code and write it involves the same creativity.

But let's be more social:

- [Medium](https://medium.com/@bredice.andrea) : the most important. You can find all the stories I write. Also, I thinks it's a truly great platform, fully based on sharing. Awesome!
- [ArtStation](https://www.artstation.com/andrea_bredice) : Yeah, I do love 3D. And some of the images you see here, were made by in [Blender](https://www.blender.org/).
- [GitHub](https://github.com/dasher7) : you can find all my code stuff, and if you like, you can use. Some of them may tell you a story.
- [Instagram](https://medium.com/@bredice.andrea) : That's my fav social amongst the "mainstream". You can see all the pictures about my travles, also, in my stories, you may find the stories I wrote.
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/andrebredi) : I recently came back to Twitter. Just for reading news.
