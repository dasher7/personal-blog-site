Let me give you an introduction. This story comes from a particular moment of my life, between August and September 2018, when I was overwhelmed by events that I did not think could really happen.
I felt the need to rework my feelings, giving it weight and shape, to visualize, analyze and metabolize them. I firmly believe that there is always something more than what we see and something more than what we are told, for these reasons here is an adventure of a story that has never been told.
Act One: Wanderer
Once upon a time there was Bì, a little red shiny plastic puppet, different from everyone else.
Bì lived in the world of humans even if he was nothing but human. Bì was named in this way to remind himself he was not wanted, he just happened.
Bì was different from everyone else, he was heartless, but still he can love, suffer, cry, and be kind. Bì was headless, but still he can reason, think and behave wisely.
Bì had no easy life down in the town. Bì was different from all other people, Bì was a little red plastic puppet living in the world of humans, where everyone one has a mouth to speak, a knee to flex, a heart to love and a mind to think, or at least they are supposed to. Being different was hard and Bì always got teased just because he was not like all other people.
Bì could not do much to avoid jokes, he had no mouth to scream and no knee to run fast, the only thing he could do was taking his pencil and a piece of paper and write his thoughts, hoping that one day someone could read them.
One day Bì was, once another time, teased by the people of the town, he was surrounded by folks but then, suddenly, something happened. When things happen, not always they happen for a very reason and most of the time they happen way too fast for us to understand. Bì felt something was catching him and suddenly he found himself in an huge open field, where everything was different from what he was used to. Grass blades tall meters, rocks almost bigger than him, field so wide that he could not see the horizon.
